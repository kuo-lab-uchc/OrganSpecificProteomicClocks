# OrganSpecificProteomicClocks

This R code is not meant to be general, mainly for deriving organ-specific proteomic clocks developed by Goeminne et al. using the UK Biobank Olink explore 3720 proteomic data. It requires a proteomic dataset, here example_proteomic_data.txt, where the first column is participant ID, followed by individual proteins. Additionally, it needs two tables with coefficients associated with each proteins in first-generation and second generation clocks that you can download from this repository (first_generaltion_clocks_coef.csv and second_generaltion_clocks_coef.csv). At the end, it will produce various first-generation and second-generation conventional and organ-specific proteomic clocks.
First-generation proteomic clocks were developed to best predict chronological age, while second-generation proteomic clocks were developed to best predict mortality. Conventional proteomic clocks were trained using all the available proteins. In contrast, organ-specific clocks were trained using proteins significantly more highly expressed in the tissue compared to other tissues in the GTex.
